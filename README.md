# Example Instrumented Ecommerce App

This is a WIP repo demonstrating observability in an eCommerce app.

It will be used as the basis for my next workshop for the Datadog Community Summit in Berlin.

It will demonstrate instrumenting and debugging a live application using Datadog, with logs, metrics, and distributed tracing.

We'll use Katacoda and gor to spin up our own (dysfunctional) stores, and then diagnose and fix them with replayed live traffic.
