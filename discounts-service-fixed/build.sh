#!/bin/bash
# Set bash strict mode so we insta-fail on any errors
# -e: Exit immediately if a command has non-zero exit code, i.e. fails somehow.
#      Otherwise bash is like a Python program that just swallows exceptions.
# -u: Exit with error message if code uses an undefined environment variable,
#     instead of silently continuing with an empty string.
# -o pipefail: Like -e, except for piped commands.
